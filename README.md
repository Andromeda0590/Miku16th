# Miku16th
This is my first model and for the meantime my last aswell. I spend 155h+ to craft this model and to learn blockbench and figura. The Wings alone took more than 50h.

Uses modified versions of SquishyAPI (by Squishy duh),
Swinging physics by manuel (modified to account for falling and y_axis movement in general 
and six skirt by PirateSee (modified to account for extra elements in the model)

Enjoy! <3
